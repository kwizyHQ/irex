# irex — VS Code extension

irex is a small VS Code extension that provides editor integrations for projects created with the IREX generator. It helps with scaffolding, commands, and editor tooling when working with IREX-based projects.

## Features

- Command palette entries for common IREX tasks (init, dev, build, generate)
- Project scaffolding helpers and templates quick-open
- Snippets and workspace configuration helpers for `fastify`, `express`, `mongoose`, and `knex` projects generated by IREX
- Lightweight README and template previews for generated apps

## Requirements

- Node.js (for extension runtime in development)
- A workspace initialized by the IREX toolchain to get full functionality

## Usage

- Open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run `IREX: Init` to initialize a workspace.
- Use `IREX: Generate Model` or `IREX: Generate Service` to scaffold code from the IREX generator templates.
- Open `README.md` files or template previews via the extension view when available in the workspace.

## Extension Settings

- `irex.enable`: Enable/disable the extension (default: `true`)
- `irex.showTemplatePreviews`: Toggle inline template previews in the explorer (default: `true`)

Add these to your workspace `settings.json` to customize behavior.

## Known Issues

- This extension provides helpers and editor UX only; it does not replace the IREX CLI. For generator operations prefer running the `irex` binary in a terminal.
- Some commands require the `irex` binary to be on your PATH.

## Development

- To run the extension locally, open this folder in VS Code and press `F5` to start the Extension Development Host.
- The extension source is in `extensions/vscode/irex/src`.

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0

- Initial release: command palette helpers, scaffolding shortcuts, and template previews.

If you'd like, I can also add a short `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the extension or wire the extension settings into `package.json` under `contributes.configuration` — tell me which and I'll update the repo.
